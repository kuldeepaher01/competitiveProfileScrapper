# Competitive Programming Profile Scrapper
Simple script that scrapes profile from Codeforces, Codechef and Leetcode.

In this script I'm particularly extracting problems solved by a person from codeforces, leetcode and codechef.

Extracted data is then stored in a csv which then can be visualised in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.
- Get the data in this form [Name,CodeforcesUsername,Leetcodeusername,CodechefUsername]
- There's no error handling done as of now so usernames must be correct
- Data must be in the above mentioned format only as serial is hardcoded.
